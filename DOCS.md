# Cerebras Coding Agent

## Overview

The Cerebras Coding Agent is an AI-powered tool that translates natural language instructions into code changes. It acts as a bridge between human intent and code implementation, helping developers work more efficiently with their codebase.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Repository Analysis** - Understands codebase structure, dependencies, and patterns
2. **Natural Language Processing** - Converts plain English instructions into actionable steps
3. **Code Generation & Modification** - Creates or updates code based on instructions
4. **Error Detection & Fixing** - Analyzes error messages and suggests appropriate fixes
5. **Contextual Awareness** - Follows existing project conventions and patterns
6. **Change Management** - Tracks modifications with option to revert changes

## Architecture

The agent is built on a modular architecture with four key components:

- **Core Agent (CerebrasAgent)** - Central controller that manages all operations
- **File Operations** - Handles file system interactions
- **CLI Interface** - Command-line interface for user interaction
- **Cerebras LLM API Integration** - Connects to AI language models

## Workflow

1. User provides instruction via natural language
2. Agent analyzes repository for context
3. Agent creates plan with file changes/shell commands
4. User reviews and accepts/rejects changes
5. Changes are applied to codebase
6. Agent can validate changes with follow-up commands

## Key Features

### Error Handling

The agent can detect, analyze, and fix errors across multiple languages:
- Parse error output from different tools and languages
- Identify error type, location, and root cause
- Generate appropriate fix approaches
- Execute and validate solutions

### Context Management

To work effectively with larger codebases:
- Intelligent context compression for token optimization
- Selective file analysis based on relevance
- Semantic prioritization of important files
- Intelligent parsing of key configuration files

### Extension Points

The agent is designed to be extensible:
- Support for additional language/framework errors
- Custom CLI commands
- Integration with development tools

## Usage Best Practices

1. Provide clear, specific instructions
2. Start with smaller tasks before complex ones
3. Maintain well-organized repositories
4. Always review suggested changes
5. Use version control for safety

## Configuration

Configure via:
- Environment variables
- Command-line options
- Configuration files

Key settings include API key, repository path, file inclusion/exclusion patterns, and context compression options.
